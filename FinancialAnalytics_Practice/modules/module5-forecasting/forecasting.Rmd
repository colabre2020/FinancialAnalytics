# R code examples for forecasting financial data

# Load necessary libraries
library(forecast)
library(tseries)

# Example 1: ARIMA Model
# Generate sample financial data
set.seed(123)
data <- ts(rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 10), frequency = 12, start = c(2020, 1))

# Plot the data
plot(data, main = "Sample Financial Data", ylab = "Value", xlab = "Time")

# Fit ARIMA model
fit_arima <- auto.arima(data)
summary(fit_arima)

# Forecast the next 12 periods
forecast_arima <- forecast(fit_arima, h = 12)
plot(forecast_arima, main = "ARIMA Forecast", ylab = "Value", xlab = "Time")

# Example 2: Exponential Smoothing
# Fit Exponential Smoothing model
fit_ets <- ets(data)
summary(fit_ets)

# Forecast the next 12 periods
forecast_ets <- forecast(fit_ets, h = 12)
plot(forecast_ets, main = "Exponential Smoothing Forecast", ylab = "Value", xlab = "Time")

# Example 3: Seasonal Decomposition
# Decompose the time series
decomposed <- decompose(data)
plot(decomposed)

# Example 4: Accuracy of Forecasts
# Compare accuracy of ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing
accuracy_arima <- accuracy(forecast_arima)
accuracy_ets <- accuracy(forecast_ets)

# Print accuracy results
print("ARIMA Accuracy:")
print(accuracy_arima)

print("Exponential Smoothing Accuracy:")
print(accuracy_ets)
